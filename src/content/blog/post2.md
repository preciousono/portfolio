When Dee Arkounting and Tax Professionals reached out, they had a website but very little visibility. Their goal was clear: attract clients organically through search engines without relying heavily on paid ads. We began with a foundational SEO strategy tailored for the Nigerian tax and accounting space, a niche that is both competitive and underserved in digital content.

Our first step was a detailed site audit. We identified missing meta tags, slow load times, and a lack of internal linking. We also noted that their blog was underutilized, with only a few generic posts that didn’t address client pain points. We created a content calendar focused on high-intent topics like “tax audits in Nigeria,” “VAT filing process,” and “how to avoid penalties.” Each blog post was optimized for keywords and structured for readability.

Over the next few weeks, we rolled out technical improvements, compressing images, restructuring page titles, and improving mobile responsiveness. We submitted updated sitemaps to Google Search Console and began monitoring index coverage and performance trends. We also added schema markup to blog articles and contact pages, improving search appearance.

This project highlighted the importance of local content relevance. Instead of trying to rank for global tax terms, we focused on location and service specific keywords that matched user intent in Nigeria.

By combining technical SEO, consistent content, and local relevance, we positioned Dee Arkounting as a credible source in the Nigerian accounting industry. Ongoing results show that with the right strategy, even niche firms can outperform bigger players online.
