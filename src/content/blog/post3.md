Hutchlam Services Limited had a professional looking website, but it wasn’t delivering results. Pages were slow, bounce rates were high, and the site ranked poorly on Google. We stepped in to run a comprehensive technical audit, aimed at uncovering the root of the performance and SEO issues holding the site back.

We evaluated everything from crawl errors and broken links to slow-loading assets and improper meta structure. The homepage alone had multiple oversized images, redundant scripts, and no H1 heading. We also discovered that most service pages lacked internal links and had poor keyword optimization.

We compiled our findings into a clear, actionable report. Recommendations included compressing images, combining scripts, adding alt text to images, and restructuring on-page headers. We also advised adding relevant keywords, improving calls-to-action, and making the site mobile-friendly.

This audit showed that technical SEO isn't just for large enterprises. Even small and mid-sized businesses benefit massively from a healthy, fast, and well-structured website.
